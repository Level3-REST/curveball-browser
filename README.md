HAL browser
===========

This package provides a middleware for HAL APIs.

The middleware looks for HAL and JSON responses, and automatically converts
them into a HTML interface if a browser access them.

It does so via the `Accept: text/html` header. If this header is not provides,
the middleware does nothing.
